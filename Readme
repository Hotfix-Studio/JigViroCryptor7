Privacy is one of the top most problems in the world. Messages and Communications between people should be protected. Privacy is everyoneâ€™s basic right. As most the messages are shared and 
communications are done electronically via emails, social media messengers, and other communication platforms on World Wide Web.  
These sources are not well secured or securities have loop holes and messages can be intercepted by other people who can use message 
against others. 
The problem is solved by encrypting messages and turning them into bunch of random characters which are meaningless and can never be 
understood without decrypting them back to the original message.
